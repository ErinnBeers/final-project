<div class="container-fluid party-rules">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p>All parties are designed to run approximately 60 minutes. You can wear whatever you like, though for chair dance you may want to wear shorts or leggings, as skirts impede the choreography.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p>We can also provide burlesque and variety performers for your event, including an entire burlesque show.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p>We do not serve alcohol or food during parties. Time to stop for drinks or snacks is not built into the class structure. However, you can book a burlesque instructor (and/or performer) to come to your party at your location!</p>

<div class="container-fluid pricing">
  <h4>Pricing</h4>
  <h2></br>Bachelorette, birthday, and hen parties are $300 for up to 10 people, plus $25 per person after 10 people. A $100 deposit is required for all plans unless otherwise noted in the plan description. Your bachelorette party is NOT confirmed until we have received a deposit.</h2>

<div class="container pay-pal"></div>

  <h4>Refund Policy:</h4>
  <p></br>If something has come up and you will not be able to plan your event with us, we do offer refunds. Please allow THREE (3) full business days before your event to request a cancellation if you would like a refund. Without this THREE (3) day notice for cancellation, we will be left holding the cost for studio rental, and the instructors will be unable to book themselves for other classes or events if they reserved their time for you. The deposit is intended to cover our costs if you must cancel with short notice.</br>

  </br>If your event (such as a bachelorette, birthday, or other private party) allows a deposit (not all classes do), that deposit is fully refundable up to ten days before the event, and 50% refundable up to a week before the event. After that it is nonrefundable and nontransferable.</br>

  </br>Parties or private lessons or events booked less than a week in advance must be paid in full in advance. If you have to cancel we will refund all but your $100 deposit. Change of date is the same for us as a cancellation because we still had to reserve your time slot and turn down other people who might have been interested.</br>

  </br>For parties, you may not consider your reservation confirmed until we have received a deposit. If we don't hear from you for awhile and don't receive a deposit, we will assume you have changed your plans.</br>

  </br>If we cancel for ANY reason—bad weather, accident, etc.—we will refund your payment as quickly as we can, even if it is difficult for us to repay you, even if it costs us additional money.</br>
